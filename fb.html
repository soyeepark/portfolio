    <h4 style = "color: #A1A1A1;"> Product Design • Side Project • September to December 2019</h4>
    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p> In this project, I redesigned the end-to-end birthday experience on Facebook. 
        After user research, I found that people find it awkward and impersonal to write on someone elses birthday timeline.
        People react emotionally differently to different people, and the way we communicate those thoughts differ 
        according to our prexisting relationship. The birthday card signature feature attempts to bridge the awkwardness
         between users when celebrating birthdays on Facebook.

        <p> Before conducting user research, I wanted to understand usability improvements on the current experience.
            Some pain-points I found are the following:
            <ul>
                <li> Birthday notifications get buried under other notifications.</li> 
                <li> Birthday notifications notify users but there is no quick action. 
                    Users need to click through two more screens to write on a birthday timeline. </li>
            </ul>

    <!-- User Research -->
    <h3> User Research </h3>
    <h5> Empathize with users </h5>

    <p> I interviewed 6 Facebook users to understand their pain-points. 
         I learned that pre-existing relationships matter when users celebrate others birthdays on Facebook. 
         Broadly the ‘closeness’ between users to were categorized into 3 types: acquaintence, friend, and best friend. 
         According to their "closeness", the medium and how people wrote a birthday message differed.

    <!-- Key Insights -->
    <h5> Key Insights </h5>

    <ol>
        <li> People feel awkward: </br>
            “I barely even post on my own feed so it feels weird to post on another person’s feed.” 
        </li> </br>

        <li> Users implicitly feel like they need to write more: </br>
            "I feel like I need to write more than 'Happy Birthday'” 
        </li> </br>

        <li> Users post only if they are somewhat close: </br>
            “It feels weird to strike a private conversation if you’ve never talked to that person online…” 
        </li> </br>

        <li> Users don’t post if they’re best friends: </br>
            “If I want to write something personal, I would do it privately.” 
        </li> </br>
    </ol>

    <h5> Problem Statement: </h5>
    <div class = "background" style = "text-align: left; font-size: 25px; line-height: 180%;">
        People want to celebrate friend’s birthday on Facebook but they feel
        stressed because writing on someone else’s timeline feels awkward and impersonal.
    </div>

    <h5 style = "margin-bottom: 2%;"> Target Audience: </h5>
    <div class = "background" style = "text-align: left; font-size: 25px; line-height: 180%;">
        People who are willing to maintain or build relationships but are not the closest friends on Facebook

    <!-- Ideation -->
    <h3> Ideation </h3>
    <h5> Opportunity Space:</h5>
        <ul> 
            <li> How might we make celebrating birthdays less awkward and more casual?</li>
            <li> How might we encourage birthday celebratations among friends on Facebook?</li>
        </ul> </br>

    <h5> Problem Solution: Birthday Card Signatures </h5>
        <ul> 
            <li> Not too public but still social: People still want the social aspect when celebrating birthdays.</li>
            <li> Fits conceptual models: People sign birthday cards in real-life too!</li>
            <li> Casual and quick: People don't have to stress because they don’t know what to write. </li>
        </ul>

    <h3> Evaluate </h3>
    <h5> Are birthday card signatures still meaningful? </h5>
    <p> To verfiy that a birthday card signature feature doesn’t come off as low-effort and careless, I interviewed 3 
        Facebook users to understand how they felt about people signing a birthday card
         rather than a timeline birthday message.

    <h5> Entry point </h5>
        <p> Users stick to their habits. After many explorations I chose to keep the entry point but improve it's accessibility. 
            I decided to create a separate birthdays section with immediate controls on the notification feed.
            Celebrating birthdays is not a passive action but an immediate one. 
            People want to say ‘Happy Birthday’ before it’s too late.
        </p> 
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt="entry point" src="images/fb/entry.png" class="img-fluid" >
        </div>

        <p> It is important to communicate the right action. I focused on finding a word with the appropriate connotation and denotation.
            I chose dismiss because wsers were not deleting or canceling someone’s birthday. Lastly, 'Ignore' sounded unfriendly.

    <h5> Birthdays Feed </h5>
            <p> When a user clicks the "See All" button, users are able to see all the birthdays on the corresponding day.
            I explored different ways to visualize the birthday signature features and ultimately chose option D.

    <h5> Birthday Card </h5>
        <p> I explored how to add the signature feature to the birthday card. 
            Through user testing, I found that a visual hierarical distinction was necessary to 
            communicate how birthday posts and signatures are different features.
        </p>
                
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt="Birthday card visual hierarchy exploration" src="images/fb/hierarchy.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
    
        <p> I explored how to encourage birthday signatures through friends while empathizing with birthday card receivers.
            Making the birthday card a number game could make the recipient feel down. For this reasons, I chose option A as it best 
             incentivized people to sign the birthday card through mutual friends.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p> Here are some visual explorations of the birthday card signature cell. 
            I explored different sizes, orientation and visual icons to select the best iteration. </p>

    <!-- Feedback -->
<h5> Feedback </h5>
<p> I explored ways to add a clearer feedback message. After user-testing I chose Option A because 
    the users thought it best communicated the completed action with the changed checkmark icon.
    Option B was confusing to the users because the ‘+’ icon made it seem like users could sign the card 
    multiple times. Lastly, on Option C, the feedback message was too small or unreadable.

    <h3> Moving Forward </h3>
    <p> 
        This this case study, I was able to excersize my design thinking skills and also focus on visual design.
        I learned to embrace the messy design process and also value testing very low-fidelity mockups. 
        Here are some areas I would have done better or would want to expand on:
    </p> 

    <ul>
        <li>
            Iterate for birthday card receiver
        </li>
        <li>
            Think about how to measure success of the feature 
        </li>
    </ul>
