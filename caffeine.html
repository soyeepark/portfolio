        <h4 style = "color: #A1A1A1;"> Product Design • Side Project • 1 week October 2020</h4>
        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> In this project, I designed the end-to-end coffee caffeine tracker app for Apple Watch.
            After research I found that people find it difficult to break bad coffee consumption habits.
            I designed a solution that provides users healthy alternatives to disencourage excess caffeine consumption.

        <h3> High-level Problem</h3> 
        <div class = "background" style = "text-align: left; font-size: 25px; line-height: 180%;">
            In a study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
            44% of people with caffeine dependence continued consumption despite harm and 
            only 23% expressed desire to cut down or control use.

        <h3> Research </h3>
    <div class = "box">
        <h5> Background Research: Risks of excess caffeine intake </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Liver damage </li>
                <li> Increase blood pressure </li>
                <li> Headache </li>
                <li> Anxiety </li>
                <li> Insomnia </li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <div class = "box">
        <h5> User Research </h5>
        <p> I interviewed people who drink Coffee on a day to day basis understand their pain-points and discover the problem. 
            My key insights are the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> People are unaware of the recommended caffeine intake
            </br>
            “When I’m drinking coffee, I don’t realize I am drinking too much and I’m not sure how much is recommended” 
            </li> </br>
    
            <li> People don't feel the need to stop drinking coffee until they experience a health problem
            </br>
                "I don't feel the need to stop drinking coffee until I experience a headache” 
            </li> </br>
    
            <li> People who drink too much coffee drink it as a habit </br>
                “I drink coffee because its just become part of my work routine.” 
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

        <h5> Competitive Analysis </h5>
        <p> I took a look at other caffeine tracking apps to identify strengths and weaknesses on how they are solving the problem.

        <div class = "background" style = "text-align: left; font-size: 25px; line-height: 180%;">
            People want to drink coffee without health risks but they can't do that because they 
            are unaware of their recommended caffeine intake and are unmotivated to break consumption habits

        <h5> Problem Solution: Caffeine tracker app that suggests other healthy alternatives when consumed over the targeted limit  </h5>
            <ul> 
                <li> Why wearable technology? Wearable tech brings convenience, real-time tracking, and efficiency. </li>

                Starting from low-fidelity paper prototypes, designs were tested for usability by A/B testing.
                For presentation, a few explorations were moved to high-fidelity. </p> -->

        <h3> Reflection </h3>
        <h5> Hardest challenges </h5>
            <p> Most watch activities are used to encourage a behavior. It was the most challenging to visualize 
                how to visualize data that limits and discourages consumption </p>

        <h5> What I learned  </h5>
            <p> How to design for small screen estate and prioritize fast selection/efficient user flow</p> 

        <h5> Moving forward </h5>
            <p> Work on prototyping dynamic micro interactions for Caffeine Watch App.</p>
