    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Contributors: Aiden Kim and Soyee Park | Tools: Figma </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Doyle is a web-based platform that helps improve communication
         between designers and developers during product hand-off. There are two parts to this case study that I self-led:
    </h5>

    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;" >
        <h5> <li> Part 1: End-to-end process </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Part 2: Design system </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h3> Part 1: End-to-end process </h3>
    <hr/>
    <h4> Research </h4>
    <h5> In our discovery phase, we conducted user interviews with designers and developers
         who had experience working together building and shipping products.
         Through these interviews, we wanted to understand users'
         key pain-points and also the root of the problem space. </h5>

    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/research.png" class="img-fluid">

    <h5> Key insights </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> There is no standard hand-off process for designers and developers causing inefficiency </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> There is no way to subjectively compare developer’s work and designs accurately: The checking process is manual and prone to errors </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Designers and developers experience lack of cross communication during handoff: One hand-off meeting is not enough </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> User Needs </h4>
    <h5> After our user interviews we identified user needs for two different stakeholders: </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Designers needs: I expect my designs to be implemented as
            documented but inconsistencies occur because the development process is not transparent with developers </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Developers needs: I want an efficient way to compare and communicate my work with designers
            but I can’t do that well because the checking process is manual and tedious </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> User Journey </h4>
    <h5> We then mapped out the user journey of our personas to create a holistic design solution.
        We re-evaluated our design goals and scope of the problem space.  </h5>
    <img style = "padding-bottom: 2%;" alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/journey.png" class="img-fluid">

    <h4> Define </h4>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Problem statement: Designers and developers want to be transparent and clear during hand-off
         but they can’t do that well because there is no standard process to communicate and compare product development
    </h5>

    <h5> Design goals </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 10px;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Allow designers and developers to analyze and compare their works directly </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Provide clear feedback on differences between designers and developers work </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Keep track of product development cycle after hand-off </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Foster communication to resolve issues both synchronously and asynchronously </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> User flow </h4>
    <h5> Based on our design goals we iterated on the most seamless user flow.
        After we arrived at our final user flow, my partner and I divided the project to design parts of the end-to-end journey.
        I focused on the second half of the user flow. </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/ia.png" class="img-fluid" style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">

    <h4> Design </h4>
    <h5> Here are some examples of the low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity explorations I did before putting together our final prototype. </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/iterate.png" class="img-fluid">

    <h5> Resolving issues </h5>

    <h5> Unresolving issues </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/resolved.gif" class="img-fluid" style = "margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 7%;">

    <h3> Part 2: Design system </h3>
    <hr/>
    <h4> Research </h4>
    <h5> Before auditing and reflecting on my own design components, I kicked off this project by looking at other successful design
         systems to understand what makes it successful.
    </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/ds.png" class="img-fluid"/>

    <h5> Key insights </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Small details create meaningful changes to the design language as a whole </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Prioritize consistency and simplicity when creating scalable designs </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Facilitate collaboration between developers and designers </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Never trade off accessibility over usability and visual design </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Learn from different patterns and value QA to understand its the systems breadth and scalability </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> Define </h4>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Problem statement: Undefined design language creates inefficiency, insecurity and inconsistency for developers and designers
    </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Opportunity area: How might we create a consistent design language that is accessible, scalable, and transparent?
    </h5>

    <h5> Success metrics: KPIs </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Adoption: Count of CSS classes, component names, or imports over time </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Coverage: Lower count of deprecated components is better </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> Audit </h4>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> I went through all visual components to understand each component's similarities and differences.
         Through reflecting on my own designs, I was able to understand inconsistencies across the system.
         Take for instance the different types of buttons used before a design system:
    </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/audit.png" class="img-fluid">

    <h5> Other inconsistencies </h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Accessibility: color contrast, touch target, font size, etc.  </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Interaction patterns: hover states, modules, etc. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Visual design: spacing, iconography, colors, etc. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Content: tone, CTAs, etc. </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h4> Process </h4>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> After my audit, I converged on one component for every pattern.
        I focused on meeting accessibility standards by paying close attention to different web states and also color contrast.
        Take for instance this example on forms. Before the design system, the form fields were inaccessible
         because they had undefined borders, low color contrast, disappearing field labels, and no focus or hover states.
    </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/forms.png" class="img-fluid">

    <h5> I made sure all text and images had a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for all components in the design system. </h5>
    <img alt="doyle" src="images/doyle/colors.png" class="img-fluid" style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">

    <h4> Final design system </h4>
