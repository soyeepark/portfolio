        <h4 style = "color: #A1A1A1;"> UX Writing Challenge • 1 Week 2020 </h4>
        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> This project is the first part of the Dropbox's UX writing challenge. This was my first attempt at a UX writing task. 
            This project outlines my strengths and interest in exploring how language can be communicated.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Final Prototype -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Final Deliverable </h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/final.png" class="img-fluid" style = "width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Communication Goals</h3>
        <p> My task was to write an email that's sent to users when they're about to run out of space on Dropbox Mocks,
             a web app that lets users design websites and apps.
             Here's the scope of the challenge: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Assume users are somewhat technical. They are probably designers who have been using Mocks for a while. </li>
            <li> Provide the paid plan but don't push the users too hard. Here, the priority is to make sure they can keep using the product. </li>
            <li> Sound like Dropbox: straightforward, helpful, and human.</li>
            <li> Write to a 6th-grade or so reading level </li>
        </ul>
        <h5> Annotate improvements </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/original.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>

        <!-- First Iteration -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> First Iteration</h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/first.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Feedback </h5>
        <ul>
            <li> Place content above the fold. Consider users viewing this email on their phones (smaller screens) </li>
            <li> Add delight when it is right. Take langugage translation into consideration. </li>
            <li> Add 'value' to solutions. Why are these solutions valuable? </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Breaking Down the Process </h3>
        <h5> Part A. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/process1.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I decided to remove the image and move the text to the top. 
            While visual relief is always valuable to give the readers a break, I realized that noteworthy content 
            should appear above the fold. 
            Especially when users have a high chance of viewing the email on their phones, with even less screen real estate avaiable,
            moving the content to the top was a priority.
        </p>
        <p> Out of the 4 options I explored, I chose the most straightforward and scannable clause.
        </p>

        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/process11.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <hr> 
        <h5> Part B. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/process2.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I wanted to surface the most scannable information to the top but also clearly communicate how much storage is left.
            I decided to choose a percentage and also include a GB conversion to give the readers flexibility in metrics. </p>
            
        <p> I removed the word 'sadly' from the transition because translation can go wrong in different languages. I learned 
            to be emotionally aware by removing text that may feel like I am presuming what another person is feeling.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h5> Part C. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/process3.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I wanted to highlight the problem and the solutions on this email. In order to focus on the visual hierarchy,
            I used increased weight on action words on each bullet and used a list to make the solutions easily scannable.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I learned that it is important to shorten your text, but it is still important to be detailed enough.
            In order to communicate 'why' people should follow these actions, I thought about the value of each action I was recommending.
        </p>

        <!-- Evaluate -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Evaluate and Verify </h3>
        <p>
            For my final checkup, I went to verify my reading level on different platforms.
        </p>

        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/verify.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Final Deliverable </h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "picture" src= "images/drop/final.png" class="img-fluid" style = "width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Moving Forward</h3>
        <p>
            I am grateful that I had the opportunity to express and explore my interest in UX writing despite not having 
            any past experiences in this field. I was able to explore the role words play in shaping people's end-to-end
            experiences.
