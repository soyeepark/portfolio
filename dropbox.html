        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> This project is the first part of Dropbox's UX writing challenge. This was my first attempt on a UX writing task. 
            This project outlines my strengths and interest in exploring how language can be communicated.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Final Prototype -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Final Deliverable </h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "Dropbox ux final" src= "images/drop/final.png" class="img-fluid" style = "width: 50%; height: auto;">

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Communication Goals</h3>
        <p> My task was to write an email that is sent to users when their Dropbox Mocks, 
             a web app that lets users design websites and apps, is about to run out of space.
             Here's the scope of the challenge: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Assume users are somewhat technical. They are probably designers who have been using Mocks for a while. </li>
            <li> Provide the paid plan but don't push the users too hard. Here, the priority is to make sure they can keep using the product. </li>
            <li> Sound like Dropbox: straightforward, helpful, and human.</li>
            <li> Write to a 6th-grade or so reading level </li>
        </ul>
        <h5> Annotate improvements </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "original UX annotation" src= "images/drop/original.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>

        <!-- First Iteration -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> First Iteration</h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "first iteration" src= "images/drop/first.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Feedback </h5>
        <ul>
            <li> Place content above the fold. Consider users viewing this email on their phones (smaller screens) </li>
            <li> Add delight when it is right. Take langugage translation into consideration. </li>
            <li> Add 'value' to solutions. Why are these solutions valuable? </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Breaking Down the Process </h3>
        <h5> Part A. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "exploration 1" src= "images/drop/process1.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I decided to remove the image and move the text to the top. 
            While visual relief is always valuable to give the readers a break, I learned that noteworthy content 
            should appear above the fold. 
            Especially when users have a high chance of viewing the email on their phones,
            moving the content to the top was a priority.
        </p>
        <p> Out of the 4 options I explored, I chose the most straightforward and scannable clause.
        </p>

        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "exploration 1 final" src= "images/drop/process11.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <hr> 
        <h5> Part B. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "ux writing exploration 2" src= "images/drop/process2.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I wanted to surface the most scannable information to the top but also clearly communicate how much storage is left.
            I decided to choose a percentage and also include a GB conversion. </p>
            
        <p> I removed the word 'sadly' from the transition because translation can go wrong in different languages. It
             is important to be emotionally aware when crafting text. One should not presume what another is feeling 
            and should consider how language translation can communicate different connotations.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h5> Part C. </h5>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "ux writing exploration 3" src= "images/drop/process3.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
        <h5> Improvements </h5>
        <p> I wanted to highlight the problem and the solutions on this email. In order to focus on the visual hierarchy,
            I increased the weight on action words and used an unordered list to make the solutions easily scannable.
        </p>
        <p> 
            People don't read but scan words, so I initially trimed down the long paragraph as much as I could. However, I realized that
            I took away too much of the content. In order to communicate 'why' people should follow these actions, I thought about the value of each 
            solution.
        </p>

        <!-- Evaluate -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Evaluate and Verify </h3>
        <p>
            For my final checkup, I went to verify the reading level of my completed draft on different platforms.
        </p>

        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "evaluate ux writing" src= "images/drop/verify.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Final Deliverable </h3>
        <div class = "background">
            <img alt = "final ux writing dropbox" src= "images/drop/final.png" class="img-fluid" style = "width: 50%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Moving Forward</h3>
        <p>
            Through this opportunity, I was able to explore the role words play in shaping people's end-to-end
            experiences and focus on visual hierarchy. I was able to excersize my design thinking skills to humanize how products are communicated.
