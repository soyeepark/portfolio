        <h1 class = "title"> Ezrabox Rebranding & Redesign</h1>
        <p> <strong> My Role: </strong> Product designer, Branding <br />
            <strong> Timeline: </strong> 2 days (branding), Redesign (In progress) <br />
            <strong> Summary: </strong> Rebranded Ezrabox and is currently redesigning its website
        </p>

        <h2 class= "subt"> Background â€” </h2> <br/>
            <p>Finding summer storage can be a real issue for students at Cornell.
                With a hectic finals schedule, limited availabilities, and
                inflexible spending power, students have to face the current
                storage options that are expensive with immovable schedules.
                Ezrabox aims to solve all the issues for summer storage faced
                by a Cornell student. <br/>
                <br/>
                We are a peer-to-peer storage platform that connects students
                who need space to store their items over summer with students
                who have space and capacity to store othersâ€™ items.
            </p>
        <h2 class = "subt"> Our History â€” </h2>
            <p> Founded in 2016, Ezrabox initially started as an advocacy
                initiative within the Cornell International Students Union.
                Over time, Ezrabox has become its own entity and went through
                the Cornell accelerator program (eLab) to become an independent
                student-led startup at Cornell. <br/>
                <br/>
                During the spring semester of 2018, Ezrabox had its first
                official operational cycle. The result of the business cycle
                included 650+ registrations on our platform, 150+ paid transactions,
                $10,000+ in total revenue and an estimated +$12,000 saved for our
                customers. Although the cycle was fairly successful for our first
                official cycle, we know we can improve.
            </p>

        <h2 class = "subt"> Revisiting our customer values â€” </h2>
            <p> There are plenty of other storage companies but what value does
                Ezrabox bring to our clients? I interviewed previous Ezrabox
                customers to understand our brand identity from the customerâ€™s
                point-of-view. <br/>
                <br/>
                Through user research, I found that people found Ezrabox
                appealing because of these reasons: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> <p> <strong> Peer-to-peer: </strong> Students liked the idea of being able to
                        earn and save money by helping another students. </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> <strong> Affordable: </strong> Studentâ€™s had to
                        pay by the weight stored, making the cost very burdensome.</p> </li>
                    <li> <p> <strong> Flexible: </strong> Students had to follow strict deadlines
                        and also couldnâ€™t make changes to drop-off or pick-up dates. </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> <strong> Safe: </strong> Students didnâ€™t feel safe (even with insurance)
                         about their storage taken away by a company without any notice on
                         where it will be left over summer. Students found it safer
                         to store it with a Cornell student where they knew exactly which
                         space their storage would be located. </p> </li>
                </ol>

        <h2 class = "subt"> Evolution of Ezrabox Logos and Website â€” </h2>
            <img src="images/evolution.png" alt="photo">
            <div id = "twophoto">
                <img src="images/old.jpg" alt="version1 of ezrabox">
                <img src= "images/old2.png" alt="version2 of ezrabox">
            </div>

        <h2 class = "subt"> So why a new logo and why now? â€” </h2>
            <p> Ezrabox did have its successful years but leadership changes made
                the startup always go through volatile branding and business cycles.
                Every year Ezrabox had a new team and a new website. This made our
                loyal customers doubt our reliability and it made it even harder
                for us to attract new customers. Most importantly, Ezrabox failing
                to launch its business last year created a lot of negative publicity
                and confusion of our company reliability and credibility. <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition to these pain points, we also wanted to rebrand to
                reconnect our clients to our business goals. In addition, we
                were looking to extend our outreach to Ithaca College as well. <br/>
                <br/>
                With these considerations in mind, our team knew we needed a new
                brand identity. I analyzed our current logo to understand its pain points in detail: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <p> Old logo looked too much like airbnb </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Branding was outdated and didnâ€™t seem visually appealing </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Logo didnâ€™t meet branding goals of Ezrabox </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Ezrabox needed to start fresh! </p> </li>
                </ol>

        <h2 class = "subt"> Our New Brand and Visual Identity â€” </h2>
            <p> Our previous logo got the job done, but it didnâ€™t have a strong brand identity.
                We wanted to also change our word mark to state who we are in a concise
                 and bold manner. The pervious word mark focused on only one of our core
                 brand values. <strong> 'Storage simplifiedâ€™ </strong> embodies the end-to-end experience
                 we hope to create for our clients. <br/>
                <br/>
                We also changed our primary color from red to orange for these reasons: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <p> The red felt too hard on the eyes and did not give off a
                        â€˜friendlyâ€™, â€˜peer-to-peerâ€™ image </p> </li>
                    <li> <p> Pink reminded too much of Airbnb. </p> </li>
                </ol>
                <p> We specifically chose orange as it is a symbolism of energy, warmth,
                and creativity. It also a color that is considered more friendly
                and inviting. </p>
