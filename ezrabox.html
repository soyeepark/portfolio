        <h4 style = "color: #A1A1A1;"> Branding • Student Startup • 2 Weeks 2020 </h4>
        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> Ezrabox is a peer-to-peer storage startup founded by Cornell students.
            As the lead designer on the team, I rebranded Ezrabox's brand identity to best communication our business goals and customer values.
            The new visual idenity is used today at Ezrabox.
        </p>

        <!-- Context -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Context: What is Ezrabox?</h3>
        <p> Ezrabox is a peer-to-peer storage platform that connects students who need space to store 
            their items over summer with students who have space and capacity to store others’ items. </p>

        <p> During the spring semester of 2018, Ezrabox had its first official operational cycle. 
            The result of the business cycle included 650+ registrations on our platform, 150+ paid transactions, 
            $10,000+ in total revenue and an estimated +$12,000 saved for our customers.</p> 

        <!-- Evolution of branding  -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Evolution of our Brand Identity</h3>
            <img alt="Evolution of branding" src="images/ezra/pastlogo.png" class="img-fluid" style = "padding-bottom: 5%;">
            <p> Since 2016 when Ezrabox was first founded, the startup went through two rebranding phases. 
                Our old logos got the job done but here’s why we changed it: </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Branding seemed outdated and visually unappealing </li>
                <li> Brand identity didn’t meet the business goals or customer values </li>
                <li> Ezrabox needed to rebuild trust from its customers from failing to launch the previous year </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Communciation goals -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Communication Goals </h3>
        <p> Before brainstorming ideas, I conducted interviews with the founders and previous users to understand our business goals and customer values. 
            I landed on two words that encapsulated an ideal customer's experience on Ezrabox
        </p>

        <div style = "align-content: center;">
            <div class = "background" style = "font-size: 25px; width: 40%; display: inline-block">
                Friendly
            </div>
            <div class = "background" style = "font-size: 25px; width: 40%; display: inline-block">
                Reliable
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Inspirations -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Inspirations </h3>
            <img alt="moodboard ezrabox" src="images/ezra/mood.png" class="img-fluid" style = "margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p> As a gathered my moodboard together I started to notice common visual elements
                 which I could incorporate into my rebranding:
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li> Use of contrasting colors between the background and the text </li>
                <li> Geometric shapes as part of logo </li>
                <li> Sans serif and bold fonts </li>
                <li> Flat or 3D iconography </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Sketches -->
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Rebrand </h3>
            <img alt="ezrabox sketches" src="images/ezra/sketches.png" class="img-fluid" style = "margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p> Before moving digital, I started with a pen and paper to brainstorm as many Ezrabox logos as I could think of.
                I explored both 2D to 3D rough sketches to find the best patterns that worked together.
            </p>
        
        <!-- Logo -->
        <h5> Logo </h5>
            <img alt="ezrabox logo brainstorming" src="images/ezra/logo.png" class="img-fluid" style = "margin-bottom: 5%; margin-top: 5%;">
            <p> After many explorations, I boiled down to three different words that come to mind when I think about ezrabox.
                I came up with different iterations that illustrate these words: peer-to-peer, storage, and safe.
                With these illustrations in mind, I tried different configurations to find a visually appealing logo design.
            </p> 

        <!-- Color -->
        <h5> Color </h5>
            <img alt="ezrabox colors" src="images/ezra/colors.png" class="img-fluid" style = "padding-bottom: 5%;">
            <p> Although red created a personal connection to Cornell students, 
                red seemed irrelevant to our brand identity. Red didn't communicate the friendly and inviting feel 
                we were striving for and it felt too hard on the eyes to use as our primary color. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                We changed our new primary color from red to orange because because it is commonly a symbolism of energy, warmth, and creativity.

            </p>
        
        <!-- Typography -->
        <h5> Typography </h5>
        <img alt="ezrabox typography" src="images/ezra/type.png" class="img-fluid" style = "padding-bottom: 5%;">
            <p> I utilized a bold and blocky font to communicate the safe and established feel of a student startup.
                I wanted to establish our reliability and I also choose a blocky font to illustrate a 
                'box'y feel that reminds our customers of a storage box.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I made sure the height of the letter 'b' was inline with the capitalized letter 'E' to make the weight of the letters 
                feel even.
            </p>

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Final Branding </h3>
            <img alt="ezrabox final" src="images/ezra/final.png" class="img-fluid">
        <hr>
        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 5%;"> Moving Forward</h3>
        <p> This was the first time I was in charge of creating an art direction and also paying close attention 
            visual design elements such as colors, typography and spacing. 
            I learned that defining emotions and communication goals are important to determine a cohesive visual identity.
        </p> 
        <p>
            To extend this project further, I would explore more on typography and also create mock-ups/posters that
            envision the logo being used on an actual product.
