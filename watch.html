    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Contributors: Soyee Park </h4>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Tools: Figma, Sketch, InVision </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 7%;" > In this project, I designed the end-to-end coffee caffeine tracker app for Apple Watch.
        After research I found that people find it difficult to break bad coffee consumption habits.
        I designed a solution that provides users with healthy alternatives to disencourage excess caffeine consumption.
    </h4>

    <h2> Research </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> In a study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
        44% of people with caffeine dependence continued consumption despite harm and only 23% expressed desire to cut down or control use.
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px" > Many studies prove that excess caffeine intake can lead to health concerns such as liver damage,
        increased blood pressure, headache, anxiety, insomnia and more. <br/>
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;" > Source: <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621326/"> Journal of Caffeine Research: Evaluating Dependence Criteria for Caffeine </a> </h4>

    <h4> After learning about these health concerns, I conducted qualitative interviews with people who drink Coffee on a
         day to day basis to understand their pain-points and nail down the problem space. My key insights were the following:
    </h4>

    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 7%;">
        <h4> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> People are unaware of the recommended caffeine intake. </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> People don't feel the need to stop drinking coffee until they experience a stomach ache. </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> People who drink too much coffee drink it as a habit. </li> </h4>
    </ul>

    <h2> Define </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Problem statement: People want to drink coffee while maintaining health but they are unaware
         of their recommended caffeine intake and don’t know how to break unhealthy consumption habits
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;" > Target Audience: Coffee lovers who care about their health and
        wellness but struggle because of excess caffeine consumption.
    </h4>

    <h4> Actionable insights:
    </h4>

    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 7%;">
        <h4> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> How might we make users aware of their recommended caffeine intake? </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> How might we alert users in advance and prevent them from health risks from too much caffeine?  </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> How might we help users break unhealthy caffeine consumption habits? </li> </h4>
    </ul>

    <h2> Ideation </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> I created an impact-feasibility matrix to brainstorm the optimal solution to the design challenge.
        I facilitated a brainstorming workshop with my friends and we synthesized our ideas into 6 buckets of ideas.
    </h4>

    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/graph.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> After the brainstorming session, we chose to iterate on the idea
        “suggest other healthy alternatives”. We thought it was the most feasible and high impact idea
         because we foresaw long-term benefits from users picking up healthier alternatives.
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 7%;"> During research, participants mentioned the importance of convenience,
        real-time tracking, and efficiency. When considering these user needs, I found that wearable tech could
        amplify the end-to-end experience as it leverages these benefits. For this case study, I chose to design
         specifically for an Apple Watch.
    </h4>

    <h2> Competitive analysis </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Before jumping into low fidelity designs, I wanted to understand how other Apple watch
         caffeine apps position their features and product. I looked at their Apple watch app but also referenced their
          mobile app as well.
    </h4>
    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/competitive1.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h4> Similar apps did not provide users with alternate suggestions.
        Instead, they were more of a journaling tool for caffeine intake.
        Through my audit, I learned about the following patterns as well:
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <h4> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Home screen provides a record of a user’s caffeine intake at a glance.
             Weekly insights are hidden to prevent overload on the homescreen. </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> Provide customization to be able to add drinks accurately and easily. Less taps and exposed/clear entry point. </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> Data visualizations are used to provide digestible information with visuals. </li> </h4>
    </ul>

    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/competitive2.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h4> In addition, I learned about patterns used specifically for Apple watch apps to understand how to design for its device: </h4>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 7%;">
        <h4> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Interactions are fast and efficient.
            Each end-to-end interaction takes around 3 taps or less. Prevent long scrolls.  </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> Use of simple visualizations that are easy to understand.
            Prevent overkill of complex visuals -- sometimes numbers and text can do just enough.  </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li> Prevent use of too much color to avoid adding excess noise.  </li> </h4>
    </ul>

    <h2> Design </h2>
    <h4> Before moving to high-fidelity designs, I started with sketching some rough ideas of the user interface.
        I went as broad as I could to design the interface. Then I iterated based on user-testing and feedback.
        Here are some of my pen and paper sketches:  </h4>

    <h2> Final </h2>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-md-6"  style = "padding-bottom: 7%;">
            <h4> Onboarding </h4>
            <h4> Answer a questionare and find your target daily coffee consumption. </h4>
            <img alt="prototype 1" src="images/caffeine/22.gif" class="img-fluid">

        <div class = "col-md-6"  style = "padding-bottom: 7%;">
            <h4> Add drinks </h4>
            <h4> Add your daily coffee consumption by drink and size. </h4>

        <div class = "col-md-6">

        </div>
    </div>

    <h2> Final </h2>
    <h4> Hardest challenges </h4>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px">  Most watch activities are designed to encourage a behavior.
        It was challenging to design a visualization to limit or discourage consumption. </h4>

    <h4> What I learned </h4>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px"> How to design on a small screen real-estate and prioritize
         fast selection/efficient user flow </h4>

    <h4> Moving forward </h4>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 5%;"> I want to work on prototyping dynamic micro interactions. </h4>
