    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Contributors: Soyee Park | Tools: Figma, Sketch, InVision </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 8%;" > In this project, I designed the end-to-end coffee caffeine tracker app for Apple Watch.
        After research I found that people find it difficult to break bad coffee consumption habits.
        I designed a solution that provides users with healthy alternatives to disencourage excess caffeine consumption.

    <h3> Research </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> In a study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
        44% of people with caffeine dependence continued consumption despite harm and only 23% expressed desire to cut down or control use.
    </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px" > Many studies prove that excess caffeine intake can lead to health concerns such as liver damage,
        increased blood pressure, headache, anxiety, insomnia and more. <br/>
    </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;" > Source: <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621326/"> Journal of Caffeine Research: Evaluating Dependence Criteria for Caffeine </a> </h5>

    <h5> After learning about these health concerns, I conducted qualitative interviews with people who drink Coffee on a
         day to day basis to understand their pain-points and nail down the problem space. My key insights were the following:
    </h5>

    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> People are unaware of the recommended caffeine intake. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> People don't feel the need to stop drinking coffee until they experience a stomach ache. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> People who drink too much coffee drink it as a habit. </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h3> Define </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Problem statement: People want to drink coffee while maintaining health but they are unaware
         of their recommended caffeine intake and don’t know how to break unhealthy consumption habits
    </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;" > Target Audience: Coffee lovers who care about their health and
        wellness but struggle because of excess caffeine consumption.
    </h5>

    <h5> Actionable insights:</h5>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> How might we make users aware of their recommended caffeine intake? </li> </h4>
        <h5> <li> How might we alert users in advance and prevent them from health risks from too much caffeine?  </li> </h4>
        <h5> <li> How might we help users break unhealthy caffeine consumption habits? </li> </h4>
    </ul>

    <h3> Ideation </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> I created an impact-feasibility matrix to brainstorm the optimal solution to the design challenge.
        I facilitated a brainstorming workshop with my friends and we synthesized our ideas into 6 buckets of ideas.
    </h5>

    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/graph.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> After the brainstorming session, we chose to iterate on the idea
        “suggest other healthy alternatives”. We thought it was the most feasible and high impact idea
         because we foresaw long-term benefits from users picking up healthier alternatives.
    </h5>

    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 5%;"> During research, participants mentioned the importance of convenience,
        real-time tracking, and efficiency. When considering these user needs, I found that wearable tech could
        amplify the end-to-end experience as it leverages these benefits. For this case study, I chose to design
         specifically for an Apple Watch.
    </h5>

    <h3> Competitive analysis </h3>
    <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Before jumping into low fidelity designs, I wanted to understand how other Apple watch
         caffeine apps position their features and product. I looked at their Apple watch app but also referenced their
          mobile app as well.
    </h5>
    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/competitive1.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h5> Similar apps did not provide users with alternate suggestions.
        Instead, they were more of a journaling tool for caffeine intake.
        Through my audit, I learned about the following patterns as well:
    </h5>

    <ul>
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Home screen provides a record of a user’s caffeine intake at a glance.
             Weekly insights are hidden to prevent overload on the homescreen. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Provide customization to be able to add drinks accurately and easily. Less taps and exposed/clear entry point. </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Data visualizations are used to provide digestible information with visuals. </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <img alt="caffiene" src="images/caffeine/competitive2.png" class="img-fluid ">

    <h5> In addition, I learned about patterns used specifically for Apple watch apps to understand how to design for its device: </h4>
    <ul style = "padding-bottom: 3%;">
        <h5> <li style = "padding-top: 2%;"> Interactions are fast and efficient.
            Each end-to-end interaction takes around 3 taps or less. Prevent long scrolls.  </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Use of simple visualizations that are easy to understand.
            Prevent overkill of complex visuals -- sometimes numbers and text can do just enough.  </li> </h5>
        <h5> <li> Prevent use of too much color to avoid adding excess noise.  </li> </h5>
    </ul>

    <h3> Design </h3>
    <h5> Before moving to high-fidelity designs, I started with sketching some rough ideas of the user interface.
        I went as broad as I could to design the interface. Then I iterated based on user-testing and feedback.
        Here are some of my pen and paper sketches:  </h5>

    <h3> Final thoughts</h3>
    <ul> 
        <h5> <li> Hardest challenges: Most watch activities are designed to encourage a behavior.
            It was challenging to design a visualization to limit or discourage consumption. </li> </h5> 
        <h5> <li> What I learned: How to design on a small screen real-estate and prioritize
            fast selection/efficient user flow </li> </h5>
        <h5 style = "padding-bottom: 5%;"> <li>  Moving forward: I want to work on prototyping dynamic micro interactions. </li> </h5>
