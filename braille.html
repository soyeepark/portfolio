    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Contributors: Han Wang, Thomas Lu, Shane Yun, Soyee Park </h4>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Tools: CAD, Laser Cutter, 3D printer, Google Vision API, Arduino </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 7%;" > The braille printer is a portable image to braille device that aims to simplify communication for people with vision impairment
        or low vision. This project explores ways people with vision impairment can see the world around them. Although braille can
        communicate language, it does not quite instill the same experience as viewing a photo or a picture. By using image processing,
        the prototype attempts to explore ways human-robot interaction can enhance ways of communication for people with disabilities.
    </h4>

    <h2> Problem space </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> Our design goal is to create a way to help people with vision impairment can see the world.
        People with vision impairment often use their tactile or auditory senses but how might we help them interpret
        the physical space around them visually?
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 7%;" > Studies have shown that people with visual impairments often lean towards other methods of communication
        than braille because they are limited by the choice of braille texts because creating them are extremely costly.
    </h4>

    <h2> Solution </h2>
    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 10px;"> The braille printer is a real-time portable image-to-braille printer.
        A user would take a picture of their surroundings or object using their phone and the image would be translated into braille.
    </h4>

    <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 7%;" > Using the Google Vision API, the user’s image will be converted into a variety of labels,
        each with a corresponding confidence score, which indicates the level of the association between the label and the image depiction.
        The label with the highest confidence score from the array will be chosen and printed.
        Then the text is translated into braille and then mapped onto the solenoid braille display.
